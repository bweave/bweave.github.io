- Use the diff between commits in [Publishing #593](https://github.com/ministrycentered/publishing/pull/593) as a case for "smart" API && "dumb" client.
- The number of React files that needed to change is eye opening.
- It's even more eye opening imagining that we'd need that same React change in CCA.
