title: Stop using Regular Expressions

Regardless of your language of choice, if you're reaching for a Regular Expression to solve a problem, I'd **strongly** suggest you consider other options first. Draw a line in the sand today, and decide that you'll only reach for Regex as an absolute last resort option. Your future self and teammates will thank you for the ease of readability. ❤️
