[![Ansible][ansible]](https://ansible.com)

Under the covers, Ansible is just SSH. No client/agent required on your remote boxes. Declare state in YAML, run your playbook, profit!

[![alt text][php7]](http://slides.erikaheidi.com/php7/)

Erika Heidi recently gave a talk about getting ready for PHP 7 and has posted up her [slide deck](http://slides.erikaheidi.com/php7/) for everyone.

<p class="lead">Automate testing your UI by comparing old and new screenshots... WAT?!?!</p>

You made some change to your app and you want to know if you broke the UI. You could either:

- Manually put up some test pages.
- Click and type around and check if everything looks normal (was that padding always there? Did the input box always behave this way? Did the unit test assert on this style?).
- Try to remember whether the new behavior was identical to the one before your change.

Or you could let [Huxley](https://github.com/chenglou/node-huxley) automate this for you.
