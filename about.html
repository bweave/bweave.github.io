            <p>I'm a husband and father of 3 beautiful girls. Family and faith are the cornerstones of my life. I love rock n' roll, homebrewing beer, and cooking with my wife. I'm a handy man thanks to my dad. I enjoy working on cars, and hope to own a 1960's era muscle car one day. I taught myself to play drums when I was 14, and spent several years playing and teaching professionally in my twenties. I'm independent and enjoy the challenge of learning new skills on my own. I'm a tinker-er at heart, and I love to build things and understand how they work. Consequently, I'm always learning something new.</p>
