            <p class="lead"><em>Hi there! I'm Brian.</em></p>

            <p>I build stuff on the internet, play drums, and brew beer.</p>

            <p>I've been working on the web for roughly 10 years. I got my start doing freelance WordPress work. Didn't we all? Ha! For the past 6 years, I've been doing full stack development: everything from server setup to CSS. I really love being involved in the full lifecycle of a product or site. The preface and first chapter of Google's recent <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Site-Reliability-Engineering-Production-Systems-ebook/dp/B01DCPXKZ6/ref=mt_kindle?_encoding=UTF8&me=">SRE book</a> basically spoke to my soul, haha!</p>

            <p>I've got extensive experience in PHP land with a focus on <strong>WordPress</strong>, <strong>Laravel</strong>, &amp; the <strong>LAMP</strong> stack. In the last 2 years, I've also done a good bit of work with <strong>Ruby on Rails</strong> and <strong>Postgres</strong>. <em>LOVE IT!</em> At this point, I'd be happy to work in PHP provided it were a greenfield Larvel project. However, given the choice, I'd choose Rails.</p>

            <p>On the frontend, I've got extensive experience with <strong>Bootstrap</strong>, <strong>Foundation</strong>, <strong>jQuery</strong>, <strong>Angular</strong>, <strong>Ionic</strong>, &amp; <strong>Backbone</strong>.</p>

            <p>And when it comes to DevOps duties, <strong>Ansible</strong> is my tool of choice. I love its power and simplicity!</p>

            <p>Other stuff that I've tooled around with include: MongoDB, EmberJS, NodeJS &amp; Express, Chef.</p>
