            <p class="lead"><em>Hi there! I'm Brian.</em></p>

            <p>I build stuff on the internet, play drums, and brew beer.</p>

            <p>I've been working on the web for roughly 10 years. I got my start doing freelance WordPress work. Didn't we all? Ha! For the past 6 years, I've been doing full stack development: everything from server setup to CSS. I really love being involved in the full lifecycle of a product or site.</p>

            <p>On the backend, I have extensive experience in PHP land with many production sites built on <strong>WordPress</strong>, <strong>CodeIgniter</strong>, &amp; <strong>Laravel</strong>. I also have experience architecting and scaling the <strong>LAMP/LEMP</strong> stack to serve 10s to 100s of thousands of users. In the last 2 years, I've done a good bit of work with <strong>Ruby on Rails</strong> and <strong>Postgres</strong>. <em>LOVE IT!</em> At this point, I'd be happy to work in PHP provided it were a Larvel project. However, given the choice, I'd choose Rails.</p>

            <p>On the frontend, I have extensive experience with <strong>Bootstrap</strong>, <strong>Foundation</strong>, &amp; <strong>jQuery</strong>. I've built single page apps with <strong>Angular</strong>, &amp; <strong>Backbone</strong>, and hybrid mobile apps with <strong>Ionic</strong>.</p>

            <p>I prefer <strong>Ansible</strong> for sysadmin/devops duties. I love its power and simplicity! Whenever possible though, I'm a huge fan of partnering vs. pioneering infrastructure and my partner of choice is <strong>Heroku</strong>. Let the fantastic engineers at Heroku do what they do best, so that I can focus on providing clients and users with value.</p>

            <p>Other stuff that I've tooled around with include: MongoDB, EmberJS, NodeJS &amp; Express, Chef.</p>
