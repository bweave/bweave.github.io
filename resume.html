                <h2>What I'm Looking For in a Team</h2>

                <p>My ideal team loves what they do as much as I do. Constantly honing their craft is second nature. Sharing new ideas and techniques is welcome. Mentoring junior teammates is expected and encouraged. Team and organization leadership is characterized by <strong>Servant Leadership</strong>. Intentionality around empowering, equipping, and growing team members both professionally and personally is the norm. Honesty, humility, integrity, kindness, laughter, healthy relationships, and a mature sense for what really matters in life describe the team and company culture.</p>

                <h2>A Little About Me</h2>

                <p>I'm a husband and father of 3 beautiful girls. Family and faith are the cornerstones of my life. I love rock n' roll, homebrewing beer, and cooking with my wife. I'm a handy man thanks to my dad. I enjoy working on cars, and hope to own a 1960's era muscle car one day. I taught myself to play drums when I was 14, and spent several years playing and teaching professionally in my twenties. I'm independent and enjoy the challenge of learning new skills on my own. I'm a tinker-er at heart, and I love to build things and understand how they work. Consequently, I'm always learning something new.</p>

As a senior-level developer, he takes great care to create code that is supportable and well tested.

His desire to innovate processes and tools helps to guide our team towards a focus of making it better. He truly takes ownership over each and every project he is a part of. Personally, he is an asset to a team. Brian is a natural encourager and takes time to mentor other developers. He is quick to stand up for other teammates and also to help them to grow by example.
